# Chapter 01: The Current Deep Learning Ecosystem


### **DISCLAIMER:** 

This part doesn’t go over anything highly technical with CUDA. Better to show you the ecosystem rather than enter technical details blindly. From my experience learning this stuff, having a decent enough understanding of the ecosystem will help you map out everything properly, and it provides that initial motivation to learn. 

As we mine further into detail, I encourage you to research and play around with what you find interesting (you will come across cool stuff in this section). If you just listen to someone talk about a subject for 20 hours, you limit your learning. Understanding breadth and depth of deep learning infrastructure is tough to navigate. Getting uncomfortable and breaking things is the best way to learn.


## Research
- PyTorch ([PyTorch - Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORMx45xqWkA&t=0s&ab_channel=Fireship))
    - If you’re watching this I assume you have at least some basic knowledge of PyTorch. If not, I suggest watching the PyTorch video by [Daniel Bourke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A)
    - Pytorch comes with nightly and stable versions ⇒ https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-nightly-vs-stable/105633
        
        the nightly releases are more likely to be unstable but offer bleeding edge pytorch updates and universal framework optimizations
        
    - Users prefer pytorch more due to the usability w/ Huggingface
    - You will find pre-trained models on torchvision (`pip install torchvision`) and `torch.hub`. The pytorch ecosystem has developed a more decentralized but slightly harder to navigate approach to getting pretrained models. People will often release their models on github repos instead of pushing to a centralized database of models. Huggingface is most commonly used due to community efforts
    - Good ONNX support
- TensorFlow ([TensorFlow - Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8NETqtGHms))
    - Well documented and lots of community support. Also most used deep learning framework
    - Comparatively the slowest DL framework
    - Created by Google (designed for TPUs) and general purpose ML (SVM, decision trees, etc).
    - Pre-trained models can be found directly on ⇒ https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets
    - Good support for pre-trained models download in 1-3 lines of code.
    - Limited ONNX support (`tf2onnx`)
- Keras
    - Similar to `torch.nn` for TensorFlow, but higher-level.
    - Separate library but deeply integrated with TF, serving as its primary high-level API
    - Complete framework for building and training modules instead of just neural network modules
- JAX ([JAX - Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0D5lXDjNpw))
    - JIT-compiled Autograd Xccelerated Linear Algebra
    - Docs here ⇒ https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - Feels like numpy
    - Reddit sentiment on JAX ⇒ https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b08qv6/d_is_it_worth_switching_to_jax_from/
    - JAX and Tensorflow are both developed by Google
    - Uses XLA (xccelerated linear algebra) compiler
    - `tf2onnx` supported
- MLX
    - Developed by Apple for Apple Silicon
    - Open-source framework
    - Focuses on high-performance machine learning on Apple devices
    - Designed for both training and inference

- PyTorch Lightning
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/t31ppy/for_what_reason_do_you_or_dont_you_use_pytorch/
    - mostly the boilerplate code reduction and distributed scaling
    - `Trainer()` as opposed to training loop

        - Reduced complexity when grid / block / thread level indexing on kernel launch parameters

- torch.compile
    - Gets more attention than TorchScript and is typically better performance
    - Compiles a model down to a static representation so the dynamic graph component of pytorch doesn’t have to worry about things changing. Runs the model as an optimized binary instead of default out-of-the-box pytorch
    - https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/the-difference-between-torch-jit-script-and-torch-compile/188167
- TorchScript
    - Can be faster in scenarios, especially when deployed in C++
    - Performance gains can be specific to your neural net architecture

## Low-Level
- CUDA
    - Compute unified device architecture (CUDA) can be thought of as a programming language for nvidia gpus.
    - CUDA libs ⇒ cuDNN, cuBLAS, cutlass (fast linear algebra and DL algorithms). cuFFT for fast convolutions (FFTs are covered in the course)
    - writing the kernel yourself based on the hardware architecture (Nvidia still does this under the hood for by passing in special flags to the compiler)
- ROCm
    - CUDA equivalent for AMD GPUs
- OpenCL
    - Open Computing Language
    - CPUs, GPUs, digital signal processors, other hardware
    - since NVIDIA designed CUDA, it will outperform OpenCL on Nvidia tasks. If you are doing work with embedded systems (EE/CE), this is still worth learning.

## Inference for Edge Computing & Embedded Systems
    
- Edge Computing refers to low-latency and highly efficient local computing in the context of real-world distributed systems like fleets. Tesla FSD is a prime example of edge computing because it has a neural net running locally on the car. It also has to send data back to Tesla so they can improve their models.
